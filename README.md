# Sentiment_Analysis_of_Covid19WFH


With the pandemic outbreak working remotely is a new normal for everyone. Our project
goal is to understand people's sentiment towards working from home. This would help
companies to decide whether they should continue remote work or implement a hybrid model or
go back to the pre-pandemic model.

We used Twitter as the primary data source, AWS as the computing platform, TextBlob and
Vader NLP algorithms, and MatplotLib and Tableau for visualization.

Performed the sentiment analysis on Work From Home (WFH) situation in Covid-19 in the
United States and other countries using TextBlob and Vader algorithms on Twitter data
with keywords searched of “WorkFromHome”, “#wfh”, ”#WFH”, ”workfromhome”,
”remotework” and ”remoteworker”.
